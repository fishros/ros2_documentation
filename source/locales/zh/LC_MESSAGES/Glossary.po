msgid "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is an interface that is provided by an \"application\", which in this case is usually a shared library or other language appropriate shared resource. APIs are made up of files that define a contract between the software using the interface and the software providing the interface. These files typically manifest as header files in C and C++ and as Python files in Python. In either case it is important that APIs are grouped and described in documentation and that they are declared as either public or private. Public interfaces are subject to change rules and changes to the public interfaces prompt a new version number of the software that provides them."
