msgstr "至少在``ament_target_dependencies``宏中不支持``Crystal Clemmys``目标名称之前，有时需要调用``target_link_libraries`` CMake函数。以Eigen3为例，调用应该如下所示："


#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:121
msgid "This will also include necessary headers, libraries and their dependencies, but in contrast to ``ament_target_dependencies`` it might not correctly order the dependencies when using overlay workspaces."
msgstr "这也会包括必要的头文件、库以及它们的依赖项，但与 ``ament_target_dependencies`` 不同的是，使用覆盖工作空间时它可能无法正确地排序依赖项。"


#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:125
msgid "It should never be necessary to ``find_package`` a library that is not explicitly needed but is a dependency of another dependency that is explicitly needed. If that is the case, file a bug against the corresponding package."

msgid "The ``ament_export_targets`` macro exports the targets for CMake. This is necessary to allow your library's clients to use the ``target_link_libraries(client my_library::my_library)`` syntax. ``ament_export_targets`` can take an arbitrary list of targets named as ``EXPORT`` in an install call and an additional option ``HAS_LIBRARY_TARGET``, which adds potential libraries to environment variables."
msgstr "``ament_export_targets`` 宏将 CMake 的目标导出。这是必要的，以便允许库的客户端使用 ``target_link_libraries(client my_library::my_library)`` 语法。``ament_export_targets`` 可以在 install 调用中使用一个名为 ``EXPORT`` 的任意目标列表，并添加一个额外的选项 ``HAS_LIBRARY_TARGET``，它将潜在的库添加到环境变量中。"


#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:162
msgid "The ``ament_export_dependencies`` exports dependencies to downstream packages. This is necessary so that the user of the library does not have to call ``find_package`` for those dependencies, too."
msgstr "``ament_export_dependencies`` 将依赖项导出到下游包。这是必要的，这样库的使用者也不必为这些依赖项调用 ``find_package``。"

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:169
msgid "Calling ``ament_export_targets``, ``ament_export_dependencies``, or other ament commands from a CMake subdirectory will not work as expected. This is because the CMake subdirectory has no way of setting necessary variables in the parent scope where ``ament_package`` is called."
msgstr "从CMake子目录调用``ament_export_targets``、``ament_export_dependencies``或其他ament命令将不会按预期工作。这是因为CMake子目录无法在调用``ament_package``的父范围中设置必要的变量。"

#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:180
msgid "Regarding the ``include directory``, the install command only adds information to CMake, it does not actually install the includes folder. This is done by copying the headers via ``install(DIRECTORY <dir> DESTINATION <dest>)`` as described above."
msgstr "关于``include directory``，安装命令只是向CMake添加信息，实际上并没有安装包含文件夹。这是通过复制头文件来实现的，方法是使用``install(DIRECTORY <dir> DESTINATION <dest>)``，如上所述。"


#: ../../source/How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Documentation.rst:183
msgid "The ``EXPORT`` notation of the install call requires additional attention: It installs the CMake files for the ``my_library`` target. It is named exactly like the argument in ``ament_export_targets`` and could be named like the library. However, this will then prohibit using the ``ament_target_dependencies`` way of including your library. To allow for full flexibility, it is advised to prepend the export target with something like ``<target>Targets``."
msgstr "安装调用中``EXPORT``标注需要额外注意：它安装了``my_library``目标的CMake文件。它的名称与``ament_export_targets``中的参数完全相同，并且可以与库的名称相同。然而，这将阻止使用``ament_target_dependencies``包含库的方式。为了实现完全的灵活性，建议在导出目标之前添加类似``<target>Targets``的内容。"

msgstr "Suppose that you have built your ROS 2 workspace with only Fast DDS installed and therefore only the Fast DDS RMW implementation built. The last time your workspace was built, any other RMW implementation packages, ``rmw_connextdds`` for example, were probably unable to find installations of the relevant DDS implementations. If you then install an additional DDS implementation, Connext for example, you will need to re-trigger the check for a Connext installation that occurs when the Connext RMW implementation is being built. You can do this by specifying the ``--cmake-clean-cache`` flag on your next workspace build, and you should see that the RMW implementation package then gets built for the newly installed DDS implementation."
