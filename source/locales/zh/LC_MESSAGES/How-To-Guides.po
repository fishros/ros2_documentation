When the service call is made, the client then passes its callback group to the Future object (hidden inside the call-method in the Python version) whose done-callback needs to execute for the result of the service call to be available. But because this done-callback and the timer callback are in the same Mutually Exclusive group and the timer callback is still executing (waiting for the result of the service call), the done-callback never gets to execute. The stuck timer callback also blocks any other executions of itself, so the timer does not fire for a second time."

msgid "Suppose that you have built your ROS 2 workspace with only Fast DDS installed and therefore only the Fast DDS RMW implementation built. The last time your workspace was built, any other RMW implementation packages, ``rmw_connextdds`` for example, were probably unable to find installations of the relevant DDS implementations. If you then install an additional DDS implementation, Connext for example, you will need to re-trigger the check for a Connext installation that occurs when the Connext RMW implementation is being built. You can do this by specifying the ``--cmake-clean-cache`` flag on your next workspace build, and you should see that the RMW implementation package then gets built for the newly installed DDS implementation."

To resolve this, you can either set the default implementation to what is was before with the ``RMW_IMPLEMENTATION`` CMake argument or you can delete the build folder for packages that complain and continue the build with ``--packages-start <package name>``."
