Second, they might build different versions of the source code.

msgstr "这可能有几个潜在原因。首先，发布任务使用最小的 ROS 安装进行构建，以检查所有依赖项是否在 `package manifest`_ 中正确声明。开发任务 / GitHub Actions / 本地构建可能在已安装了依赖项的环境中执行，因此不会注意到依赖关系问题。其次，它们可能构建不同版本的源代码。而开发任务 / GitHub Actions / 本地构建通常构建来自 *upstream* [2]_ 存储库的最新版本，`release jobs`_ 则构建最新发布的源代码，即在 *release* 存储库 [3]_ 的相应 *upstream* 分支中的源代码。"
