The `GCC visibility documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility>`__ includes step by step instructions for adding explicit symbol visibility to a library “yielding the highest quality code with the greatest reductions in binary size, load times and link times”. A header named ``visibility_control.h`` can be placed in the ``includes`` folder for each library as shown in the example below. The example below shows how a visibility control header would be added for a ``my_lib`` library with a class called ``example_class``. Add a visibility header to the include folder for the library.
