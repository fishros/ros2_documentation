msgid "``rosbag2`` doesn't just provide the ``ros2 bag`` command line tool. It also provides a Python API for reading from and writing to a bag from your own source code. This allows you to subscribe to a topic and save the received data to a bag at the same time as performing any other processing of your choice on that data. You may do this, for example, to save data from a topic and the result of processing that data without needing to send the processed data over a topic just to record it. Because any data can be recorded in a bag, it is also possible to save data generated by another source than a topic, such as synthetic data for training sets. This is useful, for example, for quickly generating a bag that contains a large number of samples spread over a long playback time."
