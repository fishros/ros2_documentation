Such mixing and matching is especially important when developers want to combine a large existing codebase using one meta-build system (e.g. ROS with ``catkin``) with new libraries and tools offered by a codebase using another meta-build system (e.g. ROS 2 with ``ament``). Ideally, that kind of combination can be done without requiring changes to the API used by either codebase and without telling the developer which builder tool to use."

The primary interface between packages (at least, CMake-controlled packages) is their CMake configuration file. So long as that configuration file follows the standard protocol (setting ``foo_LIBRARIES``, etc.), then it shouldn't matter who wrote the file. It could be auto-generated by ``catkin`` or ``ament``, or even manually crafted by a developer who wants to use plain CMake in their package, but still have that package depended-upon by ``catkin`` or ``ament`` packages."

Also, this approach to type support is normally slower than the static type support alternative.
