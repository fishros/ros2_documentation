One of the goals of this abstraction interface is to completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a minimal impact on the users code. However, we recognize that on occasion it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust settings despite the consequences that might have. By requiring the use of one of these packages in order to access the underlying DDS vendor's objects, we can avoid exposing vendor specific symbols and headers in the normal interface. It also makes it easy to see what code is potentially violating the vendor portability by inspecting the package's dependencies to see if one of these ``ros_to_dds`` packages are being used."
msgstr "In the diagram above there is also a box labeled ``ros_to_dds``, and the purpose of this box is to represent a category of possible packages which allow the user to access DDS vendor specific objects and settings using the ROS equivalents. One of the goals of this abstraction interface is to completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a minimal impact on the users code. However, we recognize that on occasion it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust settings despite the consequences that might have.
